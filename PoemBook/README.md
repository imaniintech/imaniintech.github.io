<h3>My Approach / Purpose of App</h3>
<br>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>
I love reading poems, writing poems and creating lyrics. I've use a lot of notebooks and although it's nice to write things on paper, it can become very wasteful. On top of it being wasteful, all the paper I use takes up space. In conclusion, I ended with this purpose: 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of my app is to allow users to express themselves in a poetic way (or even in a story mode). In a way, I'd call it a poem book but in other ways, it's a diary designed strictly for the user. Users can easily keep up with their thoughts and creative writings through this app.
</p>
<br>
<p>
At this point in my app, only the initial user can make any changes to it but I would like for it to also have a collaborative space for all users to engage with one another. Rather its editing another user's poem, liking the poem, commenting on the poem, or creating a story line/poem together.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It's a way for users to put themselves out there. But no worries, if you're not bold enough to put yourself into the internet world, there will be a section to where you can make your poem book public or private.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There will also be a login page for each user to either create a profile or to sign into their profile.
